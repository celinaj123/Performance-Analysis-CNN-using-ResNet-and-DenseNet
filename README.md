"# Performance-Analysis-CNN-using-ResNet-and-DenseNet" 

This code purposes to analyze the best algorithms to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the MIAS database using ResNet152 and DenseNet201 and to determine the effect of image resolution on performance analysis. The analysis was conducted to improve the performance of Benign and Malignant Mammography detection with a resolution of 128px and 224px.
